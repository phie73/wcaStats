# wcaStats

just a collection of statistics I found interesting to make. As of now:
- distribution of comps in federal states in germany [plot](foo.png)
- ((competitiors in event y) / (total competitors of comp)) / number of fist rounds in event y in germany

## to get it running

- download tsv from [here](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/export/results) safe in folder called `data`
- python virtual enviornment find out how it works for you :)
- and after it is running install all requirements doing ``pip install -r requirements.txt``
